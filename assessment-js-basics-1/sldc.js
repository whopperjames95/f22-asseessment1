// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Maintain
// Planning
// Testing & Integration

Software Development Lifecycle Correct Order:
planning
Analysis of Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing & Integration
Maintenance

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const Analysis of Requirements = "This is the second step, and is the process of determining user expecations for a new or modified product. These features , called requirements, must be quantifiable, relevant, and detailed"
const Design = "This is the third step, and is the process by which an agent creates a specification of a software artifiact intended to accomoplish goals, using a set of primitive components and subject to constraints."
const Implementaion = "This is the fourth step, and is the process of adopting and integrating a software application into a business workflow."
const Testing & Integration = "This is the fifth step, and is a type of sftware testing in which the different units, modules or ccomponents of a software application are tested as a combined entity"
const Maintenance = "This is the 6th step, and is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer/consumer needs."
